This timepicker was originally written by Martin Milesich circa 2009.  See
his original page here:
http://milesich.com/timepicker/

The link on that page to "timepicker-0.2.1.zip" is broken.  However I found
and reucisciated it from some old changelogs, and made a few tweaks myself.

NOTE: This control does not appear to be (at this point), a good choice for
new projects.  However it might be useful for folks maintaining old sites and
doing timepicker related bugfixes.

Here are some alternative timepickers that seem more new / spiffy:
